# `mx` Tenets

## Build and Architecture

* `mx` should be ridiculously easy to build.
* `mx` should not depend on any outside libraries.
* `mx` should not depened on any package manager, though it may be published into any package manager.
* `mx` should be self-contained.

## MusicXML Support

* `mx` should make MusicXML easier to use.
* `mx` should use C++ types to do a reasonably-good job of validate MusicXML.
